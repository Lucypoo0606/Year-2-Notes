## The Structural Ladder (Simplest to Complex)
### Chemical Level
- **Atoms**: Simplest building block of matter
- **Molecules**: Atoms combined
	- Form specific molecules such as water, sugar and protein 
	- These form together to produce cells and organelles
### Cellular Level
- **Definition**: Cells are the smallest form of life, and are the building blocks for all life as we know it
### Tissue Level
- **Definition**: A formation of similar cells that are a common function
- **Types**: 4 distinct types of tissue in the human body
### Organ Level
- **Definition**: An organ is a structure composed of two or more types that perform a specific function 
	- At this level, extremely complex functions become possible
- **Organ System**: The organs forms groups of organs that work together for a common purpose. 
- **Total:** There are **11** organ systems in the human body.
### Organismal Level
- **Definition:** The living human being (the organism). 
* **Significance**:** The highest level of structural organization.
- **Summary:** Represents the sum total of all structural levels working together to maintain life.
## Organ System Overview
### Integumentary System
- **Definition**: The external covering of the body
- **Parts**: Composed of the skin, hair and fingernails
- **Features/Functions**
	- **Protection***: Waterproofs the body, cushions and protects deeper tissue of the body(muscular system)
	- ****Vitamin D production***: Synthesizes the sunlight to produce Vitamin D
	-  ***Excretion:*** Eliminates salts through perspiration.
	*  ***Regulation***: Helps regulate body temperature. 
	* ***Sensation:*** Contains sensory receptors to detect changes at the body surface (touch, temp, etc.).
### Skeletal System
- Definition: Acts as the bodies framework, creating the body's shape and a rigid structure 
- Parts: Consists of bones, cartilage and joints

# Java Language Roadmap 
**Status:** #learning
**Goal:** Master the basics of Java syntax and logic.

---

## 1. The Foundation
*Before writing code, I need to understand how the language is structured.*
- [[Java Syntax and Structure]] - How classes, main methods, and file naming work.
- [[Compiled vs Interpreted]] - Brief note on how Java runs (bytecode/JVM).

## 2. Storing Data
*How Java remembers information.*
- [[Java Variables]] - How to declare and initialize variables.
- [[Primitive Data Types]] - The basic types (`int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`).
- [[String Class]] - Working with text (since it's a reference type, not a primitive).

## 3. Interaction (I/O)
*Getting data in and out of the program.*
- [[Java Output]] - Using `System.out.println` and formatting strings.
- [[Java Input]] - Using the `Scanner` class to read user input.

## 4. Control Flow (Logic)
*Making decisions and repeating tasks.*
- [[Conditional Statements]] - Using `if`, `else if`, and `switch`.
- [[Java Loops]] - When to use `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- [[Break and Continue]] - How to jump out of loops early.

## 5. Next Steps (OOP)
*Moving from procedural code to Object-Oriented design.*
- [[Classes and Objects]] - The blueprint vs. the house.
- [[Methods]] - Creating reusable blocks of code.


*List things here that you are confused about and need to research later.*
- [ ] What is the difference between `print` and `println`?
- [ ] Why does `Scanner` sometimes skip a line when reading strings?hi

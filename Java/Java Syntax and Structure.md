## Declaring a class
- Java begins with the creating of a class
	- All java Programs must contain at least a single class declaration within the code
### Basics of Declaration
- **Syntax**: Declaration starts with the class keyword, followed by the class name
- **Keywords**: Will be using the declaration of public class
	- Always spelled in lowercase and cannot be used as names for variables or classes
```java
public class class_name
```

### Class Name
 - The class name is a specific type of identifier
#### Must follow Rules
- **Allowed Characters**: Letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- **Restrictions:
	- Cannot begin with a number
	- Cannot contain a space
- Java distinguishes between cases, with *Value* and *value* being completely different
#### Conventions For Naming Classes
- By convention, class names will begin with a capital letter, with every subsequent letter being capitalized
```java
public class SampleClassName{} \\ good naming convention
public class Sampleclassname{} \\Bad Naming convention
```
#### Class Body
- After the class is named, all following within code will be wrapped in a pair of parenthesis
```java 
public class SampleClassName{
\\Code will be written within the opening and closing parenthesis
}
```
